# Epidemic Simulation Shiny App - Group Work

This repository hosts a Shiny application designed to simulate the spread of an epidemic using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). The app models the progression of a disease within a community by combining biological and psychological agent dynamics, social network interactions, and epidemic progression over time.  

## Features  

- **Dynamic Agent Modeling**: Tracks individual agents with states representing both disease progression (e.g., incubation, contagiousness) and behavioral responses.  
- **Social Network Integration**: Simulates interactions across networks such as households, schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods, using preferential attachment algorithms.  
- **Epidemic Visualization**: Provides interactive charts and visualizations to observe infection spread, immunity levels, and epidemic milestones like herd immunity.  
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to modify parameters such as contagion probability, number of interactions per day, and network configurations.  

This app was made as group work by Chesia Anyika, Joseph Romeo Waimiri, Brandon Erickson Mwangi and Daniel Nzambuli.
